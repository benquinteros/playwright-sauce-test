# **Playwright Test Suite Review**

This repository contains a set of Playwright tests written in TypeScript for the [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website. Your task is to review the code, identify issues, and suggest improvements.

## **Instructions for the Candidate**


### **2. Install Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### **3. Review the Code**

The repository contains the following files:
- **`tests/login.spec.ts`**: Test suite for login, product selection, and cart functionality.
- **`pages/LoginPage.ts`**: Page Object Model (POM) for the login page.
- **`pages/ProductPage.ts`**: Page Object Model (POM) for the product page.
- **`pages/CartPage.ts`**: Page Object Model (POM) for the cart page.

Review the code and identify any issues, such as:
- Flaky selectors.
- Hardcoded values.
- Lack of error handling.
- Missing best practices (e.g., type safety, logging, etc.).
- Opportunities for scalability and maintainability.

### 4. Run the Tests
Run the tests locally to verify their functionality:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### **5. Provide Feedback**

Prepare to discuss the following during the interview:
1. **Code Review**:
   - What issues did you identify in the code?
   - How would you improve the code?

2. **Scalability**:
   - How would you scale this test suite for a large application?
   - What changes would you make to support parallel execution?

3. **Maintainability**:
   - How would you manage test data and configuration?
   - What tools or practices would you use to ensure the tests are maintainable?

4. **Best Practices**:
   - How would you improve type safety, logging, and debugging?
   - How would you add features like screenshots, videos, or accessibility testing?

### **6. Submit Your Feedback**

After reviewing the code, submit your feedback as a **Markdown file** (`feedback.md`) in the repository. Your feedback should include:
- A list of identified issues.
- Suggested improvements.
- Any additional questions or comments.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

Your review will be evaluated based on:
1. **Code Quality**: Identification of issues and suggested improvements.
2. **Technical Knowledge**: Understanding of Playwright, TypeScript, and testing best practices.
3. **Problem-Solving**: Ability to propose scalable and maintainable solutions.
4. **Communication**: Clarity and detail in your feedback.
