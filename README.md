# **Playwright Test Suite Review**

This repository contains a set of Playwright tests written in TypeScript for the [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website. Your task is to review the code, identify issues, and suggest improvements.

## **Instructions for the Candidate**


### **Install Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### **Review the Code**

The repository contains the following files:
- **`tests/login.spec.ts`**: Test suite for login, product selection, and cart functionality.
- **`pages/LoginPage.ts`**: Page Object Model (POM) for the login page.
- **`pages/ProductPage.ts`**: Page Object Model (POM) for the product page.
- **`pages/CartPage.ts`**: Page Object Model (POM) for the cart page.

Review the code and identify any issues, such as:
- Flaky selectors.
- Hardcoded values.
- Lack of error handling.
- Missing best practices (e.g., type safety, logging, etc.).
- Opportunities for scalability and maintainability.

### Run the Tests
Run the tests locally to verify their functionality:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

   - How would you integrate logging and monitoring into this Playwright test suite to track test execution and failures?
   - What tools or libraries would you use to centralize and analyze logs (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk)?

2. **Metrics and Dashboards**:
   - What key metrics would you track for this Playwright test suite (e.g., pass/fail rates, execution time, flakiness)?
   - How would you visualize these metrics using tools like Grafana or Datadog?

3. **Tracing and Debugging**:
   - How would you use Playwright’s tracing feature to debug test failures in this suite?
   - What additional observability tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry) would you integrate to gain deeper insights into test execution?


### **6. Integration with CI/CD**
Prepare to discuss the following during the interview:
1. **Pipeline Integration**:

   - What steps would you take to ensure tests run efficiently in a CI/CD environment?

2. **Failure Handling in CI/CD**:
   - How would you handle test failures in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure the pipeline doesn’t break unnecessarily?
   - What strategies would you use to retry flaky tests or notify the team of critical failures?


### **7. Advanced Scenarios**
Prepare to discuss the following during the interview:
1. **Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Testing**:
   - How would you configure this Playwright test suite to run tests across multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (e.g., mobile, tablet)?
